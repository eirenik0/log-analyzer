# CLAUDE.md

This file is intentionally minimal.

## Canonical Guidance

Use [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) as the single source of truth for agent workflow,
style, and repo-specific policy.

## Claude-Specific Note

Only add content here if it is truly Claude-specific and cannot live in
`AGENTS.md`.

When in doubt, update [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) and keep this file as a pointer.
